# Life is hard already, let's not make it harder for each other.

*Insights on Software Engineering Management & Leadership*

Hi! I'm Cole Strode, a Senior Engineering Manager at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/)! After years in the tech industry, I've seen firsthand the impact leadership has on teams and individuals. I created this blog as a space to share what I've learned about building effective, empathetic engineering teams and leaders.

After graduating with honors in Computer Science from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), I spent nearly a decade as a hands-on engineer at various companies until I transitioned into management in 2017. 

For my first few years as a manager, I continued to code alongside my teams as a player-coach. I did this perhaps a little longer than was strictly responsible as the teams grew large (oops!), before focusing fully on the management craft.

Through this journey, I've become deeply passionate about engineering management and the impact a good manager can have not only on the team's outcomes, but also on the individuals. Through experience and continuous learning, I've found that effective management skills are best applied with empathy.

My belief in this approach led me to pursue a 3-year masters in Transformative Leadership and Social Change from the [Maryland University of Integrative Health](https://muih.edu/), and I've participated in several executive and leadership coaching programs. I've found that the more I practice these skills, the easier management becomes. In my best moments, the teams run themselves, and the work feels effortlessâ€”it's not magic, just consistent practice.

To see these ideas in action and explore related concepts, you can read more about my approach in [What is effortless management]({% post_url 2024-05-14-what-is-effortless-management %}) and explore some of my recommended management books and articles for software leaders [here](/resources).

Outside of work, in my spare time, I knit (yes, I made those socks!), run long distances, spend time with my family, and read any scary book I can get my hands on.

My core belief is that while a good manager may not make your life dramatically better, a bad manager can certainly make it worse! Life is hard already, let's not make it harder for each other.
