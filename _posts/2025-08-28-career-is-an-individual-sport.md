## Your Career Is an Individual Sport

I’ve come to define my career as an individual sport. No one else can achieve for me. I may have supporters, sponsors, even a cheering section—but when it comes down to putting in the work, I’m the one crossing the finish line.

As a long-distance runner, I don’t compete to win. I compete to improve. To stay consistent. To finish strong. I’ve used training plans, apps, even hired coaches, but in the end, it’s me logging the miles. Career growth works the same way.

I learned this firsthand during my first half marathon. Three miles in, I was cold and soaked. Rain had been falling for the last 30 minutes, and it wasn’t letting up. My shoes and socks were already drenched. Just ahead of me was a woman in a bright green Boston Marathon windbreaker. We fell into that unspoken rhythm runners sometimes find—two individuals pushing their limits, running side by side.

At mile six, a hill slowed her down and I moved ahead. Soon after, another runner joined my pace. We kept each other going through the halfway mark. But by mile eight, I was alone. Fifty minutes of hills lay ahead. That stretch—alone, tired, and soaked—was the hardest part. No one else could finish the race for me. Only I could keep putting one foot in front of the other. In my mind, it was just me and the goal.

After just over two hours and 13 miles, I accelerated through the finish arch. I had done it. Months of work. Long Sunday mornings on the trails. Countless hills. Hundreds of miles logged. The satisfaction was mine—because the effort was mine.

### You’re the Only One Who Can Train

Managers, mentors, and peers can support you—but they can’t do the work. A great manager is like a good coach: they can offer guidance, encouragement, and open doors. But they can’t run the race.

You decide where you're going. You show up every day. You put in the effort.

Waiting around for the perfect training or stretch project is like waiting for ideal weather on race day. Sometimes, you just have to run in the rain.

### Know Why You’re Running

Set goals that matter to *you*. Maybe it’s reaching Staff Engineer, leading a team, or starting something of your own. Whatever it is, be honest about *why* you want it. Blind ambition often leads to burnout or disappointment.

In running, I rarely aim to win. I aim to finish strong, maybe hit a personal record. Those goals satisfy me because they come from within—not from someone else’s scoreboard.

### Comparison Is a Pacer, Not a Rival

Watching others can help you grow—but don’t confuse pacing with racing. In long runs, I often match strides with someone for a few miles. It builds focus and momentum. Eventually, one of us pulls ahead or falls back—and that’s okay. We weren’t competing. We were helping each other stay sharp.

In your career, it’s tempting to measure progress against peers. But that can pull you off track. Use others’ success to expand your view of what’s possible—not to shrink your sense of worth.

### Learn Proactively

Don’t wait for someone to hand you a roadmap. Build your own. Read docs. Build side projects. Raise your hand for work that stretches you.

Most real growth happens outside structured programs. It comes from repetition, curiosity, and the willingness to get uncomfortable. Make time for it—even when no one’s assigning it to you.

### Talk to Your Coach

If you have a manager, let them help. Be direct about your goals. A good manager can give you feedback, stretch work, and visibility. But they’re not mind readers.

Even with a great coach, you have to do the work. Don’t delegate your development. Drive it.

### Track the Miles

Keeping a [brag doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)—and reviewing it regularly—is one of the most motivating habits you can build. It’s your training log for your career. Capture wins, feedback, lessons, and milestones.

When progress feels invisible (and it often does), your log reminds you how far you’ve come. And it helps you see where to go next.

### Reflect and Adjust

After a race, I ask: What worked? Where did I fade? What would I do differently? In this way, each run makes every future run that much better. Career reflection works the same way.

Every project, every challenge, is a chance to learn. Think about what you did—not just what you delivered. That’s where real growth happens.

### Check the Course Conditions

Not every job offers the right environment for growth. If you find your goals are consistently blocked, or you’re not feeling challenged in the ways that matter most to you, it’s worth stepping back and reassessing your situation—or your "deal," as one leader I worked with used to call it.

Are your needs being met? Do you have the room to stretch and be recognized? Are your goals realistic given your current role and team?

No job checks every box, so it helps to be clear about the outcomes that matter most to you and the tradeoffs you're willing to make. Ultimately, only you can decide whether your current path is aligned with the kind of growth you’re aiming for.

### Are You Running Your Own Race?

Here’s a quick self-check:

* Do I know what I’m aiming for?
* Am I putting in consistent effort?
* Am I growing in ways that matter to *me*?
* Am I learning from others, or competing with them?
* Is my environment helping or hindering my progress?

### Enjoy the Run

The hard parts of my first half marathon stand out—but so do the moments of joy. I kept myself going by taking in the countryside, soaking in the rhythm of the run, and letting good music fuel my pace. Even though the race was physically demanding, I found a peaceful, focused mindset that I genuinely enjoyed.

The same can be true of your career. Not every stretch will be easy, but there’s fulfillment in the challenge, and joy in the small wins. Don’t lose sight of the short-term joy—that sense of flow or accomplishment in the moment. It’s often the fuel that keeps you moving forward.

### Your Race, Your Terms

You don’t have to go it alone, but you do have to run your own race. Career growth—like distance running—is built on effort, consistency, and reflection.

Run your race well—mile by mile—and the satisfaction will follow.
