When I first began managing high level engineers, I realized quickly this required a different managerial mindset
than I had been used to. Unlike earlier-career engineers who need more guidance,
Staff+ engineers are expected to handle ambiguity and find their own paths forward. Their work is varied, part mentorship, part
technical documentation, part future planning, and some hands on coding. Identifying how to leverage each engineer's
strengths was another hurdle; some excelled in technical work, while others focused on strategy. I needed a way to both
track and encourage this diversity of work while also ensuring that I was providing the support they needed to succeed.
All without micromanaging or needing constant check-ins!

One of the most effective tools I've found for managing high-level individual contributors, particularly Staff+ engineers,
is a structured weekly update format. This not only streamlines our one-on-one meetings but also empowers engineers to take
ownership of their project progress and career development.

## The Weekly Update Format

I ask my Staff+ engineers to maintain a running document that they fill out before our weekly one-on-one meetings. This
document serves as an agenda for our discussions and is structured into six sections. The goal of these sections
is to capture the variety of work expected of a high level engineer and make sure they are getting credit for all the
[glue work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue) that comes with the job.

This format draws inspiration from Julia Evans' article on [brag docs](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/),
one of my favorite resources for engineers on how to use self-advocacy and documentation in career development.

1. **Top of Mind**: This section allows engineers to voice their most pressing concerns or questions. Whether
   it's upcoming PTO, topics that need immediate attention, or any roadblocks they're facing, this prompt
   ensures we address the most critical issues first. These are the items we'll spend the majority of our time discussing.

2. **Project Updates**: Here engineers list the projects they are currently contributing to. I encourage them
   to keep this list consistent week to week, which helps maintain accountability and track progress over time.
   This also helps me track how much work I'm assigning to them and gauge how they are handling that workload.

3. **Collaboration & Mentorship**: This section highlights the engineer's contributions to mentoring others and
   collaborating with teammates. This reinforces that Staff+ role is a leverage position and much of the value
   these engineers bring is from leveling up those around them.

4. **System Design & Documentation**: Engineers detail how they have contributed to system design decisions
   and any documentation efforts. This not only showcases their technical skills but also emphasizes their role in
  of knowledge sharing and building the understanding of their team.

1. **Company Building**: Beyond their immediate projects, I ask engineers to reflect on how they have
   contributed to the company as a whole. This could include efforts in interviewing, improving processes, or
   sharing knowledge with other teams. Recognizing these contributions fosters a sense of belonging and purpose.
   Encouraging wider participation in the company also helps engineers build a network and a reputation.
   These will become important for cross functional projects and driving their career.

2. **What You Learned**: Finally, this section encourages engineers to pursue self-driven learning. Whether
   itâ€™s a new technology, a programming language, or a professional skill, documenting their learning journey helps
   reinforce the importance of a growth mindset.

Aside from the top of mind and projects, not every section will have an entry every week, and that's okay. The key is to ensure that the document remains
consistent enough to be useful for both the engineer and myself as a manager.

The purpose of this format is to set expectations about the nature of their role and to help them keep this in
mind as they work. This is especially helpful for engineers who are moving from a Senior role into a Staff
role where the work becomes "fuzzier" and less tangible. By asking for explicit updates on the less tangible
aspects, they have the freedom pursue those while still feeling accomplished.

## The Benefits of This Format

### For Engineers

Using this structured format provides several benefits for the engineers themselves:

- **Focus and Clarity**: By outlining their thoughts and progress, engineers can prioritize what matters most
  during our limited meeting time. This clarity not only helps them articulate their contributions but also
  aligns their efforts with team and company goals.

- **Brag Document**: Over time this running document can be used to construct a brag doc or a career narrative. Engineers can use it to
  build their case for raises or promotions, showcasing their accomplishments in a clear and organized manner.

- **Self-Management**: Writing these updates weekly encourages engineers to reflect on their work and take
  ownership of their progress. This self-management is crucial for their development as high-level contributors.

### For Managers

As a manager this format benefits me as well:

- **Tracking Progress**: The weekly updates allow me to monitor the growth and progress of each engineer over
  time. This record of coaching and development is invaluable for performance reviews and career development
  discussions.

- **Minimal Effort for Accountability**: By requiring engineers to document their updates, I can hold them
  accountable with minimal effort on my part. This proactive approach fosters a culture of responsibility and
  ownership.

- **Alignment on Priorities**: A shared document ensures that we are aligned on priorities and expectations.
  This transparency helps avoid misunderstandings and keeps everyone focused on the same goals.

## Conclusion

Incorporating a structured weekly update format for Staff+ engineers has transformed the way I manage my team.
This approach not only enhances communication but also empowers engineers to take charge of their development.
By focusing on the most pressing matters and maintaining a record of their achievements, we can foster a culture
of growth and accountability that benefits both the engineers and the organization as a whole.

As you consider implementing a similar format remember that the key is to keep it simple and consistent.
Encourage your engineers to embrace this practice and watch as they flourish in their roles as high-level
individual contributors.
