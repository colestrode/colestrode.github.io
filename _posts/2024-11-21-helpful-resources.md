### The Agile Culture

_Pixton, Gibson, & Nickolaisen_

One of my absolute favorites! This book outlines ways of creating high performing teams by building a culture of high ownership and high trust.

I haven't been able to find this one on Boookshop.org, but you can buy it from [their website](http://www.theagileculture.com/).
