## Books

### The Manager's Path

_Camille Fournier_

A great resource for understanding the different roles you'll have through your career. Also some really good advice on how to work with your manager.

### Resilient Management

_Lara Hogan_

This focuses on the pure management skills for tech leadership. A really good resource.
I love everything Lara Hogan writes, it's all very simple and to the point.

### The Agile Culture

_Pixton, Gibson, & Nickolaisen_

Building high performing teams by building a culture of high ownership and high trust.

### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

_Patrick Lencioni_

An excellent and very readable book on the necessary steps of building a high performing, committed team.

### Lean Software Development

_Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck_

The "why" behind the way we build and deploy software.

### The Goal

_Eliyahu M Goldratt_

Definitely dated in its attitudes, but at its core a very good book on understanding and adapting to constraints. It's written as a narrative,
skip any section about the main character's personal life and focus on the business stuff.
