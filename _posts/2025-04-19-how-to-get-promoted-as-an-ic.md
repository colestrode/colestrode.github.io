I've seen many early career engineers become frustrated that they don't get promoted at the end of a promotion cycle. And I've seen just as many
managers surprised that those engineers expected to be promoted! No one tells you in school that getting promoted is a skill and an active process.
In this post I hope to shed some light on the steps I use with my team to give them the best chance at success for advancing up a career ladder.

This post takes you on the happy path to getting promoted, so it assumes you have a comptent manager and relatively mature company. It's not meant to
help you troubleshoot issues with an ineffective manager or dysfunctional company. Maybe I'll get to those topics another time...

## Understand your context

Before you begin, start by looking around at yourself, your manager, and your company. This builds understanding that will set you up for success later.

One misconception I think we all start our career with is that hard work will automatically be recognized and rewarded. While impactful contributions
are important they alone do not guarantee advancement, we also need to advocate for ourselves. Additionally, many engineers narrowly define success
by focusing solely on the quantity of code shipped or tickets closed, overlooking the broader impact expected as you move up to higher levels of the
career ladder.

I think early in our careers we can feel frustrated because we feel little control over our career trajectories. In reality, each of us possesses
significant agency over our professional paths, and understanding this can empower you to take charge of your growth. Furthermore, I often see engineers
surprised to learn that promotions do not happen quickly; the journey to advancement typically unfolds over months or even years.

### Understand Yourself

Start by asking yourself why you want to get promoted. Understanding your motivations is crucial. Consider what the new role entails and whether it
aligns with your interests. Ask yourself if you think you'll find fulfillment in the added responsibilities? Moving up often means increasing
collaboration with others and exercising influence without direct control. Reflect on whether you are comfortable with this dynamic.

Additionally, promotions can bring additional pressure and expectations. Check in with yourself whether you are in a good place to handle these
challenges. Taking the time to understand yourself will help you make informed decisions about your career path and set realistic goals for your advancement.

### Understand Your Manager

Your manager’s role is to set you up to succeed and sell your successes. They should engage in advice-giving (mentorship), practice
active listening and curiosity (coaching), and provide empowerment (sponsorship). Lara Hogan has a
[great post](https://alistapart.com/article/resilient-management-excerpt/) on how managers use these three skills to help you build your career.

It’s important to remember that your manager is likely not the final decision-maker in the
promotion process. I often describe my role to my team as being “an advocate, not a decider.” This is key to understand how to work with your manager:
you are partners in the journey toward promotion.

Managers face challenges such as budgets, the careers of other employees, limited project opportunities, and finite social capital. These constraints apply
to their superiors as well. Understanding the context in which your manager operates can help you approach them with realism and help prevent the
disappointment or bad feelings if they can't get you promoted right away.


 By understanding your manager’s role and working collaboratively, you can create a supportive environment that enhances your chances of promotion.

### Understand Your Company

You're company's role is to provide clarity about the expectations of every level on the career ladder and set fair, equitable, and predictable
promotion practices.

To effectively navigate your path to promotion, it’s crucial to understand your company’s promotion cycle. Find out how often promotions occur - are
they annual, bi-annual, or based on project completions? Knowing the timeline will help you plan your career conversations accordingly.

Be aware of any experience or company culture requirements for the positions you aspire to. For example, a requirement for both Senior and
Staff level engineers may be "exhibiting high ownership of projects." However, a seasoned manager will be able to tell you what ownership
at each level will look like. Chances are the bar is raised for Staff engineers, so it’s beneficial to ask your manager what they have
observed regarding the implicit expectations in the career ladder.

By understanding the promotion cycle and the requirements for each position, you can strategically position yourself for success.

## The Recipe

Now that you understand the context, your goal is to make it easy for your manager to advocate for you and show that you have met the standards
necessary for the next level. To do that, you will want to show that you have met or exceeded every competency of the job description. For those
skills you don't have yet, you want to show that you are able to grow and acquire those skills to operate at a higher level.

Let's walk through step by step how you and your manager can set you up for success.

### Have a conversation

I cannot stress this enough: talk to your manager! I've seen so many engineers disappointed when they didn't get a promotion nobody knew they wanted!

Early in the promotion cycle (like immediately after the last one ends), sit down with your manager and clearly communicate what you want and why you
believe you are ready for promotion. Approach this conversation as a partnership; your manager is there to help you succeed.
Keep in mind part of their job is to grow people on their team, so in addition to being invested in you as a person, when you advance it reflects well
on them too.

Not only do early converstaions give your manager ample time to coach, mentor, and sponsor you through the promotion cycle, often managers will start
informally raising your name for a promotion months before the promotion cycle begins. Your manager likely can only get a small handful of
promotions per cycle, so by speaking up early you are giving yourself the best chance of getting promoted later.

### Assess your skills

Begin by conducting a skills assessment based on your company’s career ladder. Your company’s definition of the role should serve as your primary
benchmark for success. Start by reviewing the job descriptions for your current position and the next level you aspire to reach. Identify the key
behaviors and outcomes outlined in these descriptions and create a checklist.

For each behavior or outcome, evaluate your current performance as “developing,” “achieved,” or “excels.” To make this assessment meaningful, provide
specific examples for those areas where you believe you have achieved or excelled. Once you have completed your self-assessment, review it with your
manager. This step is crucial, as your manager may have a different perspective on your level based on their experiences with the company and their
interactions with other engineers. While it can be challenging to hear feedback that differs from your self-assessment, listening to your manager’s
insights will better prepare you for long-term success, even if it feels disheartening in the moment.

This step is critical because it ties your skills and development to what the company says success looks like. This also helps set expectations
for you and your manager about how likely a promotion will be given your current progress.

### Write down a plan

Use the skills assessment as a foundation to build a development plan in collaboration with your manager. Group related competencies together and
identify practical, measurable ways to achieve them. For instance, if you need to develop the following skills:

1. Researching and developing best practices for technology
2. Demonstrating an understanding of software development by proposing alternative solutions and evaluating them
3. Communicating designs and decisions to engineers of different levels and abilities in a clear and actionable manner

You might set a specific development action such as “having three Requests for Comments (RFCs) proposing technical changes to our system approved by
the team this year.” This targeted approach will help you focus your efforts and track your progress effectively.

This development plan will focus your efforts this year on filling the skill gaps between your current and next level. This will also help your
manager identify stretch projects for you and provide targeted coaching and mentoring.

Make it a point to review your progress with your manager at least quarterly. This ongoing dialogue will keep your development plan aligned with your
goals and ensure you’re on the right track.

### Summarize successes in a brag doc

Tracking your own progress is your responsibility, not your manager’s. Your manager has several other engineers they are working with and likely
several responsibilities you won't see. Tracking every success you've had is hard for someone else, so make it easy on them by summarizing your
success in something like a [brag doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). Your career is more important to you than anyone else, so take
ownership of it.

For higher-level engineers, I recommend maintaining [weekly updates]({% post_url 2025-04-01-staff-plus-weekly-updates %}) that can serve as a
brag doc. This document will capture a broad swath of impacts, many of which you may forget over time. Having a real-time document makes it easier
for you to provide a summary later.

Armed with a brag doc when the time comes for your manager to advocate for your promotion they will have a comprehensive collection of evidence to
support your case, making it easier for them to champion your advancement.

## The outcome

Ultimately, the outcome of your promotion journey is outside your control and likely beyond your manager’s control as well. While no one can guarantee
a promotion, I can assure you that if you follow this career recipe you will emerge as a better, stronger, and more respected engineer by the end of
the process.

If you receive the promotion, congratulations! Celebrate this significant achievement and take pride in the hard work that got you there.

If you don’t get promoted, take the time to ask for feedback when you’re ready to hear it. Hopefully, your manager can help you identify any gaps that
you can address during the next cycle. Remember, setbacks and disappointments are a natural part of any career. It’s how you respond to these
challenges that ultimately determines your long-term success. Embrace the learning opportunities, stay resilient, and continue to focus on your growth.
