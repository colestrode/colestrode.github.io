Advancing your career as an individual contributing software engineer is a journey that requires self-awareness, strategic thinking, and dedication. Here’s how to navigate this path effectively.

## Understand Yourself

You own your career, and no one else is responsible for your growth and advancement. It’s essential to take charge of your professional journey. This means actively advocating for yourself and putting in the effort to build the skills necessary for promotion.

Start by asking yourself why you want to get promoted. Understanding your motivations is crucial. Consider what the new role entails and whether it aligns with your interests and values. Will you find fulfillment in the added responsibilities? Moving up often means increasing collaboration with others and exercising influence without direct control. Reflect on whether you are comfortable with this dynamic. Additionally, promotions can bring additional pressure and scrutiny. Assess whether you are in a good place to handle these challenges. Taking the time to understand yourself will help you make informed decisions about your career path and set realistic goals for your advancement.

## Understand Your Manager

Your manager is your partner in the journey toward promotion. It’s important to remember that they may not be the final decision-maker in the promotion process. I often describe my role to my team as being an “advocate, not a decider.” This perspective helps clarify that while they can support you, they operate within certain constraints.

Managers face challenges such as budgets, the careers of other employees, and limited social capital. These constraints apply to their superiors as well. Understanding this context can help you approach your manager with empathy and realism.

Be honest about your career aspirations. Clearly communicate what you want and why you believe you are ready for promotion. Approach this conversation as a partnership; your manager is there to help you succeed. When you advance, it reflects positively on them as well, so they are invested in your growth.

Your manager’s role includes helping you develop through different modes of interaction. They should engage in advice-giving (mentorship), practice active listening and curiosity (coaching), and provide empowerment (sponsorship). These skills are essential for fostering your development, and you can learn more about them [here](https://alistapart.com/article/resilient-management-excerpt/). By understanding your manager’s role and working collaboratively, you can create a supportive environment that enhances your chances of promotion.

## Understand Your Company

To effectively navigate your path to promotion, it’s crucial to understand your company’s promotion cycle. Find out how often promotions occur—are they annual, bi-annual, or based on project completions? Knowing the timeline will help you plan your career moves accordingly.

Additionally, be aware of any experience requirements for the positions you aspire to. Sometimes these criteria are implicit, so it’s beneficial to ask your manager what they have observed regarding these expectations. Typically, as you climb higher on the career ladder, promotions tend to be less frequent, so understanding this pattern can help you set realistic goals.

Take the time to review the job descriptions for both your current level and the next level you aim to achieve. Make sure you fully understand the expectations associated with each role. Your manager can be a valuable resource in this process, providing insights into what skills and competencies are necessary for advancement. By grasping the promotion cycle and the requirements for each position, you can strategically position yourself for success.

## The Recipe

### Skills Assessment

Begin by conducting a skills assessment based on your company’s career ladder. Your company’s definition of the role should serve as your primary benchmark for success. Start by reviewing the job descriptions for your current position and the next level you aspire to reach. Identify the key behaviors and outcomes outlined in these descriptions and create a checklist.

For each behavior or outcome, evaluate your current performance as “developing,” “achieved,” or “excels.” To make this assessment meaningful, provide specific examples for those areas where you believe you have achieved or excelled. Once you have completed your self-assessment, review it with your manager. This step is crucial, as your manager may have a different perspective on your level based on their experiences with the company and their interactions with other engineers. While it can be challenging to hear feedback that differs from your self-assessment, listening to your manager’s insights will better prepare you for long-term success, even if it feels disheartening in the moment.

### Development Plan

Use the skills assessment as a foundation to build a development plan in collaboration with your manager. Group related competencies together and identify practical, measurable ways to achieve them. For instance, if you need to develop the following skills:

1. Researching and developing best practices for technology
2. Demonstrating an understanding of software development by proposing alternative solutions and evaluating them
3. Communicating designs and decisions to engineers of different levels and abilities in a clear and actionable manner

You might set a specific development action such as “having three Requests for Comments (RFCs) approved by the team this year, proposing technical changes to our system.” This targeted approach will help you focus your efforts and track your progress effectively.

### Brag Doc

Tracking your own progress is your responsibility, not your manager’s. For higher-level engineers, I recommend maintaining weekly updates that can serve as a “brag doc.” This document should highlight your achievements and contributions, making it easier for you to communicate your progress over time.

Make it a point to review your progress with your manager at least quarterly. This ongoing dialogue will keep your development plan aligned with your goals and ensure you’re on the right track. When the time comes for your manager to advocate for your promotion, you’ll have a comprehensive collection of evidence to support your case, making it easier for them to champion your advancement.

## The Outcome

Ultimately, the outcome of your promotion journey is outside your control and likely beyond your manager’s control as well. While no one can guarantee a promotion, I can assure you that if you commit to this plan, you will emerge as a better, stronger, and more respected engineer by the end of the process.

If you receive the promotion, congratulations! Celebrate this significant achievement and take pride in the hard work that got you there.

If you don’t get promoted, take the time to ask for feedback when you’re ready to hear it. Hopefully, your manager can help you identify any gaps that you can address during the next cycle. Remember, setbacks and disappointments are a natural part of any career. It’s how you respond to these challenges that ultimately determines your long-term success. Embrace the learning opportunities, stay resilient, and continue to focus on your growth.
