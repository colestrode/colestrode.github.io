When I first began managing Staff+ engineers I faced a challenge. Unlike earlier-career engineers who need more guidance 
Staff+ engineers are expected to handle ambiguity and find their own paths forward. Their work is varied, part mentorship, part 
technical documentation, part future planning, and some hands on coding. Identifying how to leverage each engineer's 
strengths was another hurdle; some excelled in technical work, while others focused on strategy. I needed a way to both
track and encourage this diversity of work while also ensuring that I was providing the support they needed to succeed.
All without micromanaging or needing constant check-ins!

One of the most effective tools I've found for managing high-level individual contributors, particularly Staff+ engineers, 
is a structured weekly update format. This not only streamlines our one-on-one meetings but also empowers engineers to take 
ownership of their project progress and career development.

## The Weekly Update Format

I ask my Staff+ engineers to maintain a running document that they fill out before our weekly one-on-one meetings. This 
document serves as an agenda for our discussions and is structured around six key sections. The goal of these sections
is to capture the variety of work expected of a high level engineer and make sure they are getting credit for all the
[glue work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue) that comes with the job.

This format draws inspiration from Julia Evans' insightful article on [brag docs](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/), 
which emphasizes the importance of self-advocacy and documentation in career development.

1. **Top of Mind**: This section allows engineers to voice their most pressing concerns or questions. Whether 
   it's upcoming PTO, topics that need immediate attention, or any roadblocks they're facing, this prompt 
   ensures we address the most critical issues first. 

2. **Project Updates**: Here engineers list the projects they are currently contributing to. I encourage them 
   to keep this list consistent week to week, which helps maintain accountability and track progress over time. 
   This also helps me track how much work I'm assigning to them and guage how they are handling that workload.

3. **Collaboration & Mentorship**: This section highlights the engineer's contributions to mentoring others and 
   collaborating with teammates. This emphasizes that Staff+ role is a leverage position and much of the value
   comes these engineers bring is from leveling up those around them.

4. **System Design & Documentation**: Engineers detail how they have contributed to system design decisions 
   and any documentation efforts. This not only showcases their technical skills but also emphasizes the 
   importance of clear communication within the team.

5. **Company Building**: Beyond their immediate projects, I ask engineers to reflect on how they have 
   contributed to the company as a whole. This could include efforts in interviewing, improving processes, or 
   sharing knowledge with other teams. Recognizing these contributions fosters a sense of belonging and purpose.

6. **What You Learned**: Finally, this section encourages engineers to pursue self-driven learning. Whether 
   it’s a new technology, a programming language, or a soft skill, documenting their learning journey helps 
   foster a growth mindset.

Not every section will have an entry every week, and that's okay. The key is to ensure that the document remains
consistent enough to be useful for both the engineer and myself as a manager.

The purpose of this format is to set expectations about the nature of their role and to help them keep this in
mind as they work. This is especially helpful for engineers who are moving from a Senior role into a Staff
role where the work becomes "fuzzier" and less tangible. By asking for explicit updates on the less tangible 
aspects, they have the freedom pursue those while still feeling accomplished.

## The Benefits of This Format

### For Engineers

Using this structured format provides several benefits for the engineers themselves:

- **Focus and Clarity**: By outlining their thoughts and progress, engineers can prioritize what matters most 
  during our limited meeting time. This clarity not only helps them articulate their contributions but also 
  aligns their efforts with team and company goals.

- **Brag Document**: Over time this running document can be used to construct a "brag doc." Engineers can use it to 
  build their case for raises or promotions, showcasing their accomplishments in a clear and organized manner.

- **Self-Management**: Writing these updates weekly encourages engineers to reflect on their work and take 
  ownership of their progress. This self-management is crucial for their development as high-level contributors.

### For Managers

As a manager this format offers numerous advantages:

- **Tracking Progress**: The weekly updates allow me to monitor the growth and progress of each engineer over 
  time. This record of coaching and development is invaluable for performance reviews and career development 
  discussions.

- **Minimal Effort for Accountability**: By requiring engineers to document their updates, I can hold them 
  accountable with minimal effort on my part. This proactive approach fosters a culture of responsibility and 
  ownership.

- **Alignment on Priorities**: A shared document ensures that we are aligned on priorities and expectations. 
  This transparency helps avoid misunderstandings and keeps everyone focused on the same goals.

## Conclusion

Incorporating a structured weekly update format for Staff+ engineers has transformed the way I manage my team. 
This approach not only enhances communication but also empowers engineers to take charge of their development. 
By focusing on the most pressing matters and maintaining a record of their achievements, we can foster a culture 
of growth and accountability that benefits both the engineers and the organization as a whole.

As you consider implementing a similar format remember that the key is to keep it simple and consistent. 
Encourage your engineers to embrace this practice and watch as they flourish in their roles as high-level 
individual contributors.
