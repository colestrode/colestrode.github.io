## üîç Why These Choices

- **Backgrounds**: Nearly black with a cool tint to reduce eye strain and avoid flatness.  
- **Text**: Off-white for readability, softer than pure white; muted blue-gray for secondary hierarchy.  
- **Accents**: Teal and green shifted lighter for visibility on dark surfaces.  
- **Highlights**: Gold brightened to feel like sunlight against night; Coral adjusted to stay vibrant and attention-grabbing.  
- **Dividers**: Subtle separation without harsh contrast.

## üìå Usage Tips

- Maintain the same ratios as light mode (‚âà70% neutrals, 20% cools, 10% warms).  
- Use overlays for legibility on nature imagery.  
- CTAs: Coral with white text, hover to Gold.  
- Focus states: Teal outlines with faint glow.  
- Keep charts/diagrams transparent with accent colors, not boxed backgrounds.
